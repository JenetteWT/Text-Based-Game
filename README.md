# Text-Based-Game
Developed a budget management game where players navigate a lively mall while practicing user interaction and decision-making logic.
In the game, players must pick up six essential items for an upcoming vacation — sandals, swimsuit, dress, waterproof phone case, perfume, and pizza — without overspending. Favorite mall stops include the shoe store, food court, swimwear shop, pet store, clothing store, beauty shop, bank, and electronics store. Players must avoid distractions like tempting sales clerks (nicknamed "Miracles") who try to lure them into unnecessary purchases. If players buy more than the six needed items, they risk running out of money and having to cancel their trip. Strategy, focus, and quick decision-making are key to success in this mall full of miracles. Good luck!
